# PI-in-the-Sky
Our first semester project
## Planning
### Goals
Launch a raspberry pi into the sky measuring and recording accelerometer data along it's flight and ensure that the pi is not broken when it lands.
### Method
Using a air canon we will launch a inclosed capsule which will hold a Raspberry Pi, accelerometer, battery, and parachute to slow its decent.
(Optional) the air canon can additionally be mounted on a platform of some kind which can be adjusted or just held
### Materials
#### 1 - 12
1. PVC tubing
2. Valve
3. air hose
4. air compressor
5. ABS plastic
6. wires
7. battery
8. accelerometer
9. Raspberry PI
10. parachute
11. fittings
12. PVC glue/sealent
### Timeline
#### weeks 1-2: planning and modeling
-finish projectile model
-decide on launch method
-start design of launch methond
-source springs and materials
#### weeks 3-4: construction testing/Coding
-find out how to determine tilt
-build launch method
-assemble projectile
#### week 5: troubleshooting and polishing
-ensure that projectile stays level in flight
-work out kinks in parachute deployment
### Inital Design

### Solidworks Design
### Code 
we need to measure and record the data from our accelerometer as well as using the data to determine tilt of the projectile while ignoring acceleration
